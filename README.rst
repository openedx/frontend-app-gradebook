Purpose
*******

Gradebook allows course staff to view, filter, and override subsection grades for a course. Additionally for Masters courses, Gradebook enables bulk management of subsection grades.

For existing documentation see:

- Basic Usage: `Review Learner Grades (read-the-docs) <https://docs.openedx.org/en/latest/educators/how-tos/data/view_learner_grades.html>`_
- Bulk Grade Management: `Override Learner Subsection Scores in Bulk (read-the-docs) <https://docs.openedx.org/en/latest/educators/how-tos/data/manage_learner_grades.html#override-learner-subsection-scores-in-bulk>`_

Should I use Gradebook in my course?
*************************************

What does this offer over the legacy gradebook?
================================================

The micro-frontend offers a great deal more granularity when searching for problems, an easy interface for editing grades, an
audit trail for seeing who edited what grade and what reason they gave (if any) for doing so.

UsageProblems can be filtered by student as in the traditional gradebook, but can also be filtered by scores to see who
scored within a certain range, and by assignment types (note: Not problem types, but categories like 'Exams' or
'Homework').

What does the legacy gradebook offer that this project does not?
=================================================================

This project does not (yet, at least) create any graphs, which the traditional gradebook does. It also does not give
quick links to the problems for the instructor to visit. It expects the instructor to be familiar with the problems they
are grading and which unit they refer to.

The gradebook is expected to be much more performant for larger numbers of students as well. The Instructor Dashboard
link for the legacy gradebook reports that "this feature is available only to courses with a small number of enrolled
learners." However, this project comes with no such warning.

Who should not change to this gradebook?
=========================================

Groups whose instructors need not ever manually override grades do not need this project, but may not be any worse off
depending on their needs. Instructors that expect to review grades infrequently enough that not having a direct link
to the problem in question will have a worse UX than the legacy gradebook provides. Instructors that rely on the graphs
generated by the current gradebook might find the lack of autogenerated graphs to be frustrating.

Getting Started
***************

Installation
============

To install gradebook into your project:

.. code-block:: bash

  npm i --save @edx/frontend-app-gradebook

Quickstart
==========

Cloning and Setup
-----------------

1. Clone your new repo:

   .. code-block:: bash

     git clone https://github.com/openedx/frontend-app-gradebook.git

2. Use the version of Node specified in ``.nvmrc``

3. Stop the Tutor devstack, if it's running:

   .. code-block:: bash

     tutor dev stop

4. Next, we need to tell Tutor that we're going to be running this repo in development mode, and it should be excluded from the mfe container that otherwise runs every MFE. Run this:

   .. code-block:: bash

     tutor mounts add /path/to/frontend-app-gradebook

5. Start Tutor in development mode. This command will start the LMS and Studio,
   and other required MFEs like ``authn`` and ``account``, but will not start the
   Gradebook MFE, which we're going to run on the host instead of in a container
   managed by Tutor. Run:

   .. code-block:: bash

     tutor dev start lms cms mfe

Startup
-------

1. Install npm dependencies:

   .. code-block:: bash

     cd frontend-app-gradebook && npm install

2. Start the dev server:

   .. code-block:: bash

     npm run dev

Running the UI Standalone
==========================

To install the project please refer to the `MFE Development on Tutor <https://github.com/overhangio/tutor-mfe?tab=readme-ov-file#mfe-development>`_ instructions.

When not mounted, gradebook will run in the shared MFE container at http://apps.local.openedx.io/gradebook/course-v1:edX+DemoX+Demo_Course.

When mounted in the tutor ``gradebook`` container, or when running a local (host) webpack dev server, the web application runs on port **1994**, so when you go to http://apps.local.openedx.io:1994/gradebook/course-v1:edX+DemoX+Demo_Course you should see the UI (assuming you have such a Demo Course in your devstack).  Note that you always have to provide a course id to actually see a gradebook.

(Note: This may not work in Tutor; these instructions are for the deprecated Devstack) You can see the log messages for the docker container by executing ``make gradebook-logs`` in the ``devstack`` directory.

Note that starting the container executes the ``npm run start`` script which will hot-reload JavaScript and Sass files changes, so you should (:crossed_fingers:) not need to do anything (other than wait) when making changes.

Plugins
*******

This MFE can be customized using `Frontend Plugin Framework <https://github.com/openedx/frontend-plugin-framework>`_.

The parts of this MFE that can be customized in that manner are documented `here </src/plugin-slots>`_.
